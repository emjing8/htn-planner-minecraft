The most complicated case your HTN planner can solve in 30 seconds
of real-world time:

given: {"wood": 3, "coal": 2,}
achieve: {"cart": 2, "rail": 32, "bench": 1, "ingot": 27}

The task is to:
1. Craft 3 wood into 12 plank
2. Use 4 planks to create bench (8 planks remain)
3. Use 4 planks to create 8 sticks (4 planks remain)
4. Use 3 planks and 2 sticks to create a wooden pickaxe (1 planks and 4 sticks remains)
5. Mine 3 cobble.
6. Use remaining 2 sticks and 3 cobble to create stone pickaxe (5 planks remain) 
7. Mine 59 ore and 6 coal
8. Smelt ore into ingot
9. Craft 2 carts (total 10 ingots)
10.Craft 2 rail (total 12 ingots and 2 stick)

The time cost in recipe time: 797 units
The time cost in real world: 2.3 seconds, the code cannot do anything more complicated, because it 
reaches maximum depth beyond this.
